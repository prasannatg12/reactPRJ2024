However, the more devices you have with simultaneous users, the higher the speed that is recommended for optimal performance. With speeds of 200/200M or greater, new equipment may be required at your location. A technician will assess what is needed in your home. In most cases, we will need to add new cabling from your Optical Network Terminal (or ONT) to your Wi-Fi router. Depending on the location of your ONT to your router, we may need to drill a hole (or holes) to run the cable. We will make the cables as inconspicuous as we can but they may have to be run along base boards, along eaves, or go through rooms.
